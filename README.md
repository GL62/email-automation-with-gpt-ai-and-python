# email-automation-with-gpt-ai-and-python
An example of using the OpenAI API in python to automate email responses

1. This script was created to automatically reply to emails in an email inbox using OpenAI API. 
   The script allows you to reply to only unread messages or to all messages in the inbox. 
   Sent messages are moved to the specified folder.

2. The program is ready to use.
   Only fill in the API key and login information and Install OpenAI library: pip install openai

3. If you find a bug or have an idea to improve the program, please e-mail me.
